To do list for the Wrapper.

Add a property to disable to the force exit on double CTRL-C feature.
It is easy to forget and accidently force shut an application to shutdown
hard when it shouldn't be possible.

The new feature to hide the java console when running as a service which is
interactive does not work correctly when rebooting the machine because the
console does not actually show itself until the user logs on.  By that time
the wrapper has given up on hiding the console.  This leads to the console
remaining open.  We probably need to add a check in the main event loop
so we atempt to hide it until we have succeeded.

Documentation:

Add instructions on how to integrate with an application which is normally run
from a bundled jar file.  Ie the main class is specified using the
Main-Class: {classname} entry in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.

Add instructions/feature to show users how to get the Wrapper to launch an
application when the machine reboots.  There for Windows, but not yet for
UNIX.
Debian: update-rc.d
RedHat: chkconfig
?: insserv

For Debian, do the following:
ln -s /home/leif/dev/sourceforge/wrapper/bin/testwrapper /etc/init.d/testwrapper
update-rc.d testwrapper defaults 21
(See http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s-sysvinit)

Add a section giving examples of how to integrate the Wrapper with a project
at build time.  Show how to make platform specific builds etc using Ant.

Add tests to make sure that wrapper.java.additional.n and wrapper.app.parameter.n
properties do not contain unquoted spaces.

Add tests to make sure that wrapper.java.library.path.n and
wrapper.java.classpath.n properties do not contain quotes.

When a thread dump is requested on a failed exit, the dump shows
up after the message about the JVM being killed.  Rework that part
of the state engine so that the dump is logged right after it is
requested.  THEN wait for a few seconds before killing the JVM.  I
have a feeling that truncated dumps are still possible the way it
is now.


Look into what happens when a second instance of the WrapperManager
class is loaded to due to a different class loader.  See if there
is a way to catch this and display a useful error.


Notes on how to detect a user login:
http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Languages/MFC/Q_20714147.html
NetUserGetInfo returns information about a user once the username is known.
GetUserName returns the current user name.  But this won't help from a service as we want
  the logged in user.
OpenInputDesktop??

Iterate of all Threads calling GetThreadDesktop on each one.  Then compare
it with the value returned by OpenInputDesktop.
http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_20592976.html

The DisplayLocalLogons function in loggedon.c of the source from the psloggedon
utility gets us to the point of having a list of all logged on local users.
On XP, there can be more than one so we need to go a little farther.
Also need to check the license of the code to see if we can borrow it.

If the interactive flag is off, the correct desktop returns access denied 0x5.
The other desktops return 0x57, invalid parameter.

If the interactive flag is on, the correct desktop can be opened and the other
desktops return 0x57.

Got the following error message when running as a service at Hitachi.
This was with interactive and console both set to false.
Attempt to set the console tile failed: ƒnƒ“ƒhƒ‹‚ª–³Œø‚Å‚·B (0x6)


The "ant clean doc" target fails when run under JDK 1.4.2  May need to
upgrade Cocoon?


An support for Security Managers to protect access to certain WrapperManager
method calls.  Look in the Avalon i18n ResourceManager class for an example.


What happens if I set the O_NDELAY bit on the pipe from the JVM?


Hitachi ran into a problem where the Wrapper deadlocked somewhere
in the main event loop.  The JVM timed out and quit on its own
after it stopped receiving pings.  Sending a SIGQUIT to the Wrapper
woke it up and caused it to launch a nwe JVM.  It had been locked
for several days.
This sounds like FreeBSD problem which was fixed for 3.1.1.  That
fix is only used on FreeSD however as it sounds like it was a
FreeBSD / OpenBSD only problem.

Great overview at http://www.microsoft.com/msj/archive/S402.aspx
Look at GetProcessMemoryInfo as a way to get memory info about the Wrapper and Java processes.
Look at GetProcessTimes to get CPU usage of a process.

The prstat command shows all of the info needed to get memory and cpu usage.  if necessary look at its source.
The times function can be used to get the CPU usage for the current process or its children.
The getrusage function gives us lots of info, but also just for the current process or its children.

See getrusage, getrlimit, setrlimit, GETRLIMIT

Look at ChangeServiceConfig2.  It appears to make it possible to set the error recovery
actions for an NT service.
