To do list for the Wrapper.

Documentation:

Add instructions on how to integrate with an application which is normally run
from a bundled jar file.  Ie the main class is specified using the
Main-Class: {classname} entry in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.

Add instructions/feature to show users how to get the Wrapper to launch an
application when the machine reboots.  There for Windows, but not yet for
UNIX.

Add a section giving examples of how to integrate the Wrapper with a project
at build time.  Show how to make platform specific builds etc using Ant.

Add tests to make sure that wrapper.java.additional.n and wrapper.app.parameter.n
properties do not contain unquoted spaces.

Add tests to make sure that wrapper.java.library.path.n and
wrapper.java.classpath.n properties do not contain quotes.
