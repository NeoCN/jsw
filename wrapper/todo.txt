To do list for the Wrapper.

Documentation:

Add instructions on how to integrate with an application which is normally run
from a bundled jar file.  Ie the main class is specified using the
Main-Class: {classname} entry in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.

Add instructions/feature to show users how to get the Wrapper to launch an
application when the machine reboots.  There for Windows, but not yet for
UNIX.

Add a section giving examples of how to integrate the Wrapper with a project
at build time.  Show how to make platform specific builds etc using Ant.
