                Setting up the scripts used to launch the Java Service Wrapper is
                extremely simple.  Simply copy the following 3 batch files from the
                Wrapper distribution into the bin directory of your application.

                Be sure to remove the <literal moreinfo="none">.in</literal>
                extensions so that the files all end in
                <literal moreinfo="none">.bat</literal>.  Depending on how
                your file explorer is configured, you may not be able to see
                the extensions.

                The three batch files are used to run an application in a console,
                and to install and remove it as an NT Service.  These scripts
                should not require any modification.  However, they do assume that
                they are placed into the same directory as the
                <literal moreinfo="none">Wrapper.exe</literal> executable.  They
                also assume that the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal>
                file will be located within a <literal moreinfo="none">conf</literal>
                directory one level up,
                <literal moreinfo="none">../conf/wrapper.conf</literal>.  If
                you wish to locate either of these files elsewhere, then the three
                batch files will require appropriate modifications.

            <para>
                Running the application in a Command Window (console) can be done by
                double clicking on the <literal moreinfo="none">MyApp.bat</literal>
                batch file from within the file explorer.  Or by opening a Command
                Window and then running the script from the command prompt.  The
                scripts do not require that you be in the
                <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory.

                The application can be terminated by hitting CTRL-C in the command

            <para>
                Before proceeding, please make sure you have configured all of the
                <ulink url="props-nt.html">NT service</ulink> related
                properties in the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal>
                file.  You should also have verified that the application runs
                correctly in console mode.

            <para>
                The application can be installed as a service by double clicking on
                the <literal moreinfo="none">InstallMyApp-NT.bat</literal> batch
                file from within the file explorer.  Or by opening a Command Window
                and then running the install script from the command prompt.  If the
                service is installed successfully, the script will terminate
                immediately.  If there are any problems then an error message
                describing what went wrong will be displayed.  The script will then
                wait for the user to press a key before terminating.

                Once the service has been installed, it can be started by opening up

            <para>
                The service can also be started and stopped from within a Command
                Window by using the <literal moreinfo="none">net start MyApp</literal>
                and <literal moreinfo="none">net stop MyApp</literal> commands, or
                by passing commands to the <ulink url="#exe">Wrapper.exe</ulink>

                To run the Java Service Wrapper as a console application, you would
                specify the <literal moreinfo="none">-c</literal> command, followed
                by the wrapper.conf file.  The location of the
                <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal> file can be an
                absolute or relative location.  If a relative path is used, the path
                is always relative to the location of the
                <literal moreinfo="none">Wrapper.exe</literal> file, not the current
                directory.

                Once installed, the service can be started just like any other NT
                service.  If the <ulink url="prop-ntservice-starttype.html">wrapper.ntservice.starttype</ulink>
                was set to <literal moreinfo="none">AUTO_START</literal> when
                installed, then the service will be started the next time the
                machine is rebooted.  It is also possible to start the service
                manually from the services control panel, or by executing either
                of the following two commands:

            <note>
                <para>
                    The <literal moreinfo="none">net start x</literal> and
                    <literal moreinfo="none">net stop x</literal> commands have problems
                    with services that take a long time to start or stop.  In most
                    cases they will work, but if a service takes more than a few seconds
                    to stop, the <literal moreinfo="none">net stop x</literal> command
                    will return that the service was stopped even though it is still in
                    the process of stopping.  This can lead to problems when a script
                    must wait until a service has actually stopped before proceeding.
                    By using the Wrapper to start and stop the service, you will be
                    guaranteed not to have any such problems.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The Wrapper method of starting and stopping the service is also
                    useful in scripts as it does not require the actual name that
                    the service is installed as to exist anywhere except in the
                    <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal> file.  This
                    removes the need for manual editing of multiple files if the
                    service name is changed.

            <para>
                The service can be stopped using the services control panel, or by
