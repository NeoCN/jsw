            The Java Service Wrapper includes a native library component, and thus
            requires that the location of that library be specified by passing its
            location to the JVM using the java.library.path system property.

        <para>
            Normally when Java is launched and a library path is not specified, the
            JVM will default to using the system PATH to locate any native libraries
            loaded by the application.   This is akin to what happens with the
            CLASSPATH environment variable when a specific classpath is not specified
            when launching the JVM.   The use of the CLASSPATH environment variable
            has fallen out of style because of all the conflict problems which can
            arise when multiple Java applications are installed on the same machine.
            The same issues are all there with the library path as well.  But some
            applications still make use of the system PATH by default.

            In general, it is advised that you avoid potential problems when your
            application is deployed by being conservative about which directories
            will be included in the java library path.   However if there is a need
            to search the entire PATH, then this property will cause the Wrapper to
            append the contents of the system PATH to the java library path used to
            launch the JVM.  The PATH is appended rather than prepended so that
            directories configured using the
            <ulink url="prop-java-library-path-n.html">wrapper.java.library.path.&lt;n&gt;</ulink>
            properties will be given priority.  Defaults to false.
