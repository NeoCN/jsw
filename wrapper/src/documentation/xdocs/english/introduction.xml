                    We needed to be able to install our application as an NT service.  There were other solutions to this, but none of them were flexible enough to meet our needs and all required recompilation for each application.  We also wanted a solution which could be used to run our application on Win32, Linux and Solaris platforms.

                    The stability of Java applications with early versions HotSpot left much to be desired.  The JVM would occasionally crash or freeze up.  We needed a way to detect when this had happened and get our application up and running as quickly as possible.
