                    Added a new batch file which accepts commands like the UNIX shell script.
                    The new file is offered as an alternative to the default batch files, and
                    can be found at <literal moreinfo="none">src/bin/AppCommand.bat.in</literal>.
                    Thanks to Mike Castle for donating the new script.  See the new
                    <ulink url="launch-win.html#command">Command-Based Script</ulink>

                    The Windows version of the Wrapper was not correctly registering that it
                    would accept SHUTDOWN messages when running as a service.  The Wrapper
                    was getting the message anyway so this should not change functionality.
                    Thanks to Jason Tishler for noticing this and sending in a patch.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Add a new property, <ulink url="prop-native-library.html">wrapper.native_library</ulink>,
                    which can be used to specify the base name of the native library which is
                    loaded by the WrapperManager class.

                    Modify the WrapperManager class so it now stores references to System.out
                    and System.err on initialization and always writes to those stored streams.
                    This makes sure that all Wrapper console output always goes to the
                    wrapper.log file even if user code overrides those streams with calls to
                    System.setOut and System.setErr.  This was necessary to prevent deadlocks
                    in such user code from affecting the functionality of the Wrapper.

                    Fixed a problem where some environment variables where not being correctly
                    loaded from the system registry when running as an NT service.  Big thanks
                    to Eric Smith for tracking this down and submitting a patch.  It turns out
                    that the putenv function was not being used correctly.

                    Modified the way the wrapper.conf file is loaded so it will now read the
                    contents correctly even if the line feeds in the file are incorrect for
                    the current platform.  Windows line feeds had been causing problems when
                    used on UNIX platforms.

                    Added support for SGI Irix.  Big thanks to Andreas Wendt for supplying the

                    Due to a bug in the build, the native library was not included in the 3.0.3
                    or 3.0.4 binary releases for OSX, building from source was working correctly.
                    This has been fixed and the build greatly simplified to avoid such problems
                    in the future.

                    Changed the default location of the pid file generated by the sh script to
                    exist in the same directory as the sh script rather than in the /var/run.
                    This can be changed by setting the PIDDIR variable in the sh script used to
                    launch the Wrapper.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Added support for the <ulink url="prop-pidfile.html">wrapper.pidfile</ulink>

                    <simpara>
                        (WINDOWS USERS) If you are using a wrapper.conf file that was created prior
                        to version 3.0.0 of the Wrapper, then you may have this property defined in
                        your configuration file.  You will get an error on startup if the specified
                        path does not exist.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Added the <ulink url="prop-java-pidfile.html">wrapper.java.pidfile</ulink>
                    property which will cause the pid of the java process to be written to a
                    specified file.

                    Stop clearing the file creation mask when the Unix version of the Wrapper is
                    run as a daemon process.  The file creation mask will not be inherited from
                    the process which launches the Wrapper.

                    Modify the sh script so it works on Linux, then deprecate the bash script.
                    This means that all Unix platforms can now use the same script to control
                    the Wrapper. Thanks to Mike Castle for the patch.  The bash script can still
                    be found in the release, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a
                    future version.

                    Modified the sh script so it is now possible to set the nice priority in the

                    Remove output to System.out in the WrapperManager.requestThreadDump() method.
                    If some JVM threads were hung while accessing the System.out object,
                    attempting to do a thread a dump would cause the calling thread to hang as
                    well.  Thanks to Thomas Hart for the patch.

                    Make it obvious in the log whether or not the Wrapper was started as a

                    Modify the way restarts requested from the JVM, or caused by a filter are
                    handled.  The Wrapper will no longer reset the restart count in either of
                    these cases.  If an application runs for longer than the
                    <ulink url="prop-successful-invocation-time.html">wrapper.successful_invocation_time</ulink>
                    timeout then the count will still be reset back to 0.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Added a new <ulink url="prop-ignore-signals.html">wrapper.ignore_signals</ulink>
                    property which makes it possible to configure the Wrapper so it will ignore
                    CTRL-C, HALT and INT signals.

                <para>
                    Modify the WrapperManager.isLaunchedAsService() method on UNIX systems so it
                    now returns true if the Wrapper was launched with the
                    <ulink url="prop-daemonize.html">wrapper.daemonize</ulink> flag set.

                    Added a pair of MBean interfaces which allow the Wrapper to be controlled
                    using JMX.  See the new <ulink url="jmx.html">JMX</ulink> section in the
                    documentation for details.  Thanks to Sal Ingrilli for help with testing.

                    Modify the Windows build so the Wrapper.exe and Wrapper.dll files can now
                    be built from <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</ulink> if MSVC is

                    Added a new <ulink url="prop-ping-interval.html">wrapper.ping.interval</ulink>
                    property which lets users control the frequency that the Wrapper pings the JVM.
                    <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=607768&amp;group_id=39428&amp;atid=425190">Feature Request #607768</ulink>.

                    When a JVM refuses to shutdown, the Wrapper can be configured to request a
                    thread dump using the <ulink url="prop-request-thread-dump-on-failed-jvm-exit.html">wrapper.request_thread_dump_on_failed_jvm_exit</ulink>
                    property.  The Wrapper was then waiting 1 second before the process was
                    killed.  This was not always long enough, resulting in a truncated thread
                    dump.  Increased the pause to 3 seconds.

                    Fix a problem on UNIX systems where requesting a second thread dump any time
                    during the life of a single Wrapper process would cause the Wrapper and JVM
                    to shutdown rather than perform the thread dump.

                    Fix a problem where a, user without permission, attempting to stop an
                    application was able to delete the pid file even though they were unable
                    to stop the application itself.  This would make the scripts think that
                    the application was stopped when was actually still running.

                    Fix a problem where an application was being killed prematurely if it took
                    longer than 6 seconds to exit on its own.  The scripts now make sure that
                    an application always has enough time to shutdown cleanly.

                    of "net start" and "net stop", which do not always work correctly when a

                    Fix bug #744801.  A Java GUI was not being displayed when the application was

                    Fix a problem where the JVM was not receiving CTRL-C and CTRL-CLOSE events
                    when running under the Wrapper on Windows.  This was not a problem in most

                    the WrapperListener.controlEvent() method was not being called as documented.

                    Made it possible to use the wrapper.pidfile property on all *nix platforms.
                    Please notice that the property has been removed from the default
                    wrapper.conf file.  The property is not needed when the wrapper is launched
                    with the bash shell script.  The sh shell script will set the wrapper.pidfile
                    when the wrapper is launched.  If either of the scripts provided with the
                    Wrapper distribution are used then the wrapper.pidfile should always be
                    removed from your wrapper.conf file.

                    Added a new wrapper.daemonize property which, when set, will form the wrapper
                    process to be a detached non-session group leader.  This makes it possible to
                    launch the wrapper in such a way that it will not be terminated when the user
                    launching the process logs out.  This had been a problem on Solaris systems
                    when using the sh shell.  The default sh and bash scripts both make use of
                    this in the default.  Please update your scripts for use with this version.
                    Thanks to Rajiv Subrahmanyam for the patch.

                    This would cause the Wrapper to terminate the process prematurely in
                    cases where an application shutdown thread took longer than 5 seconds to
                    complete.  The Wrapper not allows wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout seconds for
                    the JVM process to exit on its own before being forcibly terminated.

                    When there is a configuration problem or a resource is unavailable, a JVM
                    will sometimes exit abnormally very shortly after being launched.  This
                    can lead the the JVM being infinitely restarted due to a simple class
                    path misconfiguration.  To work around this, the Wrapper has always had
                    a hard limit of 5 restarts within a short period of time.  If the JVM
                    has been running for more than a few minutes, then the count was reset.
                    In this version, a new property. wrapper.max_failed_invocations was added
                    to allow the max value to be set.   The time period which the JVM must
                    now be running for the JVM launch to have been considered a success for
                    restart purposes is set using the new wrapper.successful_invocation_time
                    property.

                    The number of advanced properties which most users do not need has been
                    increasing as the Wrapper has been made more and more flexible.  This
                    has been causing confusion in their usage by people who play with them
                    without first reading the documentation.  To solve this, the advanced
                    properties were removed from the default configuration file.  They still
                    function.  But users must now read to the advanced configuration
                    documentation to learn about their existence.  Added quite about to the
                    descriptions of these properties to hopefully clear up any confusion

                    pause, a new JVM would still be launched.  The new JVM was exiting
                    immediately but it was a waste of time.  The Wrapper now recognizes the

                    Fixed a problem on windows where the java command was looking in the windows
                    system and system32 directories for the java executable before checking the
                    path when the full path to the java executable was not specified in the
                    configuration file.  This could lead to different JVM being run from the
                    Wrapper than was run if java -version was run from the command line.  The
                    Wrapper will now attempt to resolve the full java path using the PATH
                    environment variable.
