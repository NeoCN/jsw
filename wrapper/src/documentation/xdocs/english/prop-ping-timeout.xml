        <para>
            Number of seconds to allow between the wrapper pinging the JVM and
            the response.  0 means never time out.  Defaults to 30 seconds.

            In normal operation, the Wrapper pings the JVM once every 5 seconds
            to make sure that its process has not frozen up.  The ping timeout
            is the amount of time to allow for a response from the JVM before
            the Wrapper assumes that it is hung and restarts it.

            With the addition of the
            <ulink url="prop-cpu-timeout.html">wrapper.cpu.timeout</ulink>
            property, there is now almost no reason why you should ever need
            to change this property.  The only reasons why you should be
            getting ping timeouts are if the system is under heavy load or
            if the JVM is really hung.  The CPU timeout should now detect
            any problems in with CPU.

                While the ability is there.  Be aware that
                setting this property to 0 or some large value will mean
                that the Wrapper's ability to detect a JVM hang as it is
                running will be disabled.
