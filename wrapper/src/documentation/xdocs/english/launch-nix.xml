            <para>
                The Wrapper is shipped with a <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal>
                script which can be used to reliably start and stop any Java
                application controlled by the Java Service Wrapper.
            </para>
            <para>
                First copy the <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal> script to the
                <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory of your
                application.
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen format="linespecific"><![CDATA[{WRAPPER_HOME}\src\bin\sh.script.in]]></screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                Rename the script file to reflect the name of the application.
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen format="linespecific"><![CDATA[/usr/lib/myapp/bin/myapp]]></screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                Now open the script into an editor.  We need to set the long and
                short names to reflect that the script is being used to launch
                your application.  You will see two variables immediately after
                the header of the script.  <literal moreinfo="none">APP_NAME</literal>
                and <literal moreinfo="none">APP_LONG_NAME</literal>.  Note that
                the default values of both of these variables are
                <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</ulink> friendly
                tokens which can easily be replaced as part of a build.
                Suggested values for these variables are shown below.
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen format="linespecific"><![CDATA[APP_NAME="myapp"
APP_LONG_NAME="My Application"]]></screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>
                The script should not require any additional modification.
                However it does assume that it is placed into the same directory
                as the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper</literal> executable.
                It also assumes that the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.conf</literal>
                file will be located within a
                <literal moreinfo="none">conf</literal> directory one level up,
                <literal moreinfo="none">../conf/wrapper.conf</literal>.  If
                you wish to locate this file someplace else, then that can also
                be set using the <literal moreinfo="none">WRAPPER_CONF</literal>
                variable in the script.
            </para>
            <note>
                <para>
                    Important!  Before proceeding, please make sure that both
                    the script and the <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper</literal>
                    executable have their executable bit set.
                </para>

            <note>
                <para>
                    The <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal> script will attempt to
                    create a pid file in the <literal moreinfo="none">/var/run</literal>.
                    If the user used to launch the Wrapper does not have permission to
                    write to this directory then this will result in an error.  An
                    alternative that will work in most cases is to write the pid file
                    to the same directory where the wrapper executable is located.  To
                    make this change, edit the <literal moreinfo="none">sh</literal>
                    script and change the following line:

                The application can now be run by simply executing
                <literal moreinfo="none">bin/myapp console</literal>.
                Because of the way the Wrapper script sets its current directory,
                it is not necessary to run this script from within the
                <literal moreinfo="none">bin</literal> directory.
            </para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen format="linespecific"><![CDATA[/usr/lib/myapp/bin/myapp console

            <para>
                The application can be terminated by hitting CTRL-C in the command
                window.  This will cause the Wrapper to shut down the application
                cleanly.
            </para>
            <para>
                As you will see if you omit a command, the scripts shipped
                with the wrapper are fairly standard daemon scripts.  They
                accept <literal moreinfo="none">console</literal>,
                <literal moreinfo="none">start</literal>,
                <literal moreinfo="none">stop</literal>,
                <literal moreinfo="none">restart</literal>,
                <literal moreinfo="none">status</literal>, and
                <literal moreinfo="none">dump</literal> commands.
                The <literal moreinfo="none">start</literal>,
                <literal moreinfo="none">stop</literal>, and
                <literal moreinfo="none">restart</literal> commands are common
                to most daemon scripts and are used to control the wrapper and 
                its application as a daemon process.  The 
                <literal moreinfo="none">status</literal> command
                can be used to find out whether or not the wrapper is currently
                running.  The <literal moreinfo="none">console</literal> command
                will launch the wrapper in the current shell, making it
                possible to kill the application with CTRL-C.  The final
                command, <literal moreinfo="none">dump</literal>, will send a
                <literal moreinfo="none">kill -3</literal> signal to the wrapper
                causing the its JVM to do a full thread dump.
            </para>

            <title>Running as a Daemon Process</title>
            <para>
                The application can be run as a detatched daemon process by
                executing the script using the <literal moreinfo="none">start</literal>
                command.
            </para>

            <para>
                When running using the <literal moreinfo="none">start</literal>
                command, output from the JVM will only be visible by viewing the
                <literal moreinfo="none">wrapper.log</literal> file using
                <literal moreinfo="none">tail -f wrapper.log</literal>
            </para>
            <para>
                Because the application is running as a detatched process, it can
                not be terminated using CTRL-C and will continue to run even if
                the console is closed.
            </para>
            <para>
                To stop the application rerun the script using the
                <literal moreinfo="none">stop</literal> command.

                Installing the application to start up when the system boots and
                shutdown when the system shutsdown is platform specific.  I have
                tried to include instructions for platforms which I have access
                to.  If your platform is not included, please read over those that
                have been included and adapt as necessary.  Please post what you
                come up with to the

                mailing list and I will be more than happy to include them in the
                next release.
