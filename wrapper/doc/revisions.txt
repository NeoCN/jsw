Java Service Wrapper Revision History.
--------------------------------------
2.2.5
* Fixed bug issue when reading config files from Windows on Unix.
* Deprecated the wrapper.debug property in favor of loglevels.
* Added new logger functionality includes the following features:
  Loglevels like Log4j, NT Eventlog support, UNIX syslog support and rolling
  log files.
* Added wildcard support for classpath entries in wrapper.conf.
* Added the ability to specify configuration properties from the command line.
* Changed the way NT services are installed so that a patched version of the
  Wrapper.exe file no longer needs to be created to reference the
  wrapper.conf file.

2.2.4
* The value of APP_NAME in the bash or sh scripts no longer needs to be the
  same as the script.
* Added the ablility to format and/or disable file logging and output to the
  console.
* Set mode of executables in binary release tar files so that they can be run
  without modification after being extracted.
* Fixed line feeds in release so that bat files are always CRLF, unix scripts
  are always LF.  Other source files are always CRLF in ZIP archives and LF
  in tar.gz archives.
* Make the build fail if Wrapper.exe or Wrapper.dll do not exist for Windows
  builds.
* Added an empty wrapper.log to the releases so that the TestWrapper example
  program runs out of the box.

2.2.3
* Added template scripts and conf files for ease of integration with other
  applications.
* Cleaned up the build.
* The WrapperSimpleApp method of launchine applications was not working 
  correctly with applications whose main method did not return.
* Add sample scripts and wrapper.conf files in the bin and lib directories.
  These scripts are used to start a sample application which runs out of the
  box.  See the new example.html page in the documentation for more details.
* Get rid of the platform specific directories in the bin and lib directories.
* Enable relative paths for Windows version.  In previous versions of Wrapper,
  it was necessary to always use absolute paths because the working directory 
  of the wrapper would be then NT System32 directory when run as a service.
* On the windows version, the wrapper always sets the current working
  directory to the location of the wrapper executable immediately after
  startup.
* Improvements to the documentation / web page.

2.2.2
