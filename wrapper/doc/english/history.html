            Early in 1999, after having played with Java for a few months, Leif
            Mortenson ran into a problem with a service that he had been developing.
            There was no way to install the Java application as an NT service.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            The solution was to write a replacement for the java executable which
            had the ability to be installed as a service.  This version of the
            wrapper worked by loading the jvm.dll and then launching a new JVM
            instance using JNI.

<p align="justify">
            In October 1999, Leif joined a startup company called SilverEgg.  Over the
            next year, SilverEgg developed a recommendation engine, called Aigent,
            for use in web site personalization.  As Aigent was built in Java, it had
            the same problem with being installed as an NT service as some of Leif's
            previous projects.  The Wrapper code was brought in from home and used as
            part of the Aigent product to provide that functionality.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            In March 2000, Ryan Shaw joined SilverEgg and brought with him a wealth
            of knowledge of the Linux OS.  All platform specific portions of the Aigent
            product, including the Wrapper, were ported over to Linux.  At this point
            was still a very simple tool for running installing a JVM as a service.
            Its usefulness on Linux was limited to making it easier to run the product
            on both platforms with common configuration files.

<p align="justify">
            In November 2000.  Aigent began having serious stability problems.  The
            product would work perfectly for 2-3 weeks at a time.  All memory and
            performance were perfectly flat.  Then all of a sudden, the JVM would
            crash with a Hot Spot Access Violation.  This was very bad as the product
            was installed at a couple customer sites at the time.  A few weeks were
            spent trying to track down the problems.  But no headway was made and the
            customers were getting tired of the procedure of having to restart their
            server every week to avoid the crash.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            Leif came up with the idea of modifying the Wrapper so that it would run
            the JVM in a spawned process rather than as a DLL.   This way if the JVM
            process crashed or hung for any reason, the Wrapper process would still
            be alive and in a position to do something about it.  This Wrapping and
            monitoring of the JVM process is where the Java Service Wrapper project
            got its current name.  This new functionality turned out to be very useful
            on the Linux platform as well.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            After a few more months, the cause of Aigent crashing turned out to be
            an ArrayList which was not being synchronized correctly.  The HotSpot
            compiler had optimized the code in such a way that if two threads accessed
            the ArrayList in a certain way at the same time, the JVM would crash.  The
            code was accessed several times per second under load tests, so why it
            reliably took 2-3 weeks to reproduce is anyone guess.  But the Wrapper had
            proved its usefulness by getting Aigent through its rough spell
            guaranteeing that any loss of service due to a JVM crash never lasted
            more than a few seconds.

            Realizing that the Wrapper would most like be very useful to a lot of other
            users, Ryan and Leif decided to give something back to the open source
            community.   A project was registered on SourceForge and the Java Service
            Wrapper had its first public release in November 2001.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            The first version of the Wrapper was was not very flexible, having been
            designed for a few specific applications.  Over the first few versions a
            lot of work was done to create documentation as well as adding several
            features to make it much more configurable.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            Within a month of the first release, the Wrapper was ported to its first
            new platform, Solaris.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            Johan Sorlin (Spocke) joined the project in January 2002 after contributing
            a great new logging architecture which made it possible for the Wrapper to
            log to the Windows event log and Unix syslog.
        </p>
        
<p align="justify">
            In April 2002, after having suffered the same fate as so many other great
            internet companies, Silver Egg was forced to close its doors.  Ryan and
            Leif both moved on to new jobs but continued to maintain the Wrapper on
            private time as had been done since its initial release on SourceForge.

            In January of 2003, the decision was made to rework the documentation and
            web site.  The project was transferred back to TanukiSoftware.org, which is
            owned by Leif.  This was to guarantee the open source future of the Wrapper
            project and help disassociate it from SilverEgg, which no longer had any
            involvement in the project.  Thanks to the management for making this
            transfer possible.

            they were maintained as wrappers around the classes in the new packages
            to maintain forward compatibility for the user base.
